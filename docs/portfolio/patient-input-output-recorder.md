[Patient Side](https://lifeadventurer.github.io/patient-input-output-recorder/patient/)
[Monitor Side](https://lifeadventurer.github.io/patient-input-output-recorder/monitor/)

This project is a simple tool for recording and tracking essential health parameters of patients. It provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to log various health metrics, including food intake, water consumption, urine volume, defecation frequency, and weight, along with corresponding timestamps for each entry. This information can be valuable for healthcare professionals to monitor and analyze the health status of patients over time.

Uses [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for dependency management and includes, ruff and pre-commit for linting and formatting.

## Importance for Kidney Disease Management

In particular, it plays a crucial role in managing conditions such as kidney disease, where strict control over water intake is essential for maintaining health and preventing complications.

## Getting Started

1. Set your token: First, navigate to the `config.json` file located in the `backend` directory. Update the file by replacing `{your_token_here}` with your actual token in the following format:

    ```json
    {
        "token": "{your_token_here}"
    }
    ```

2. Run your server: Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    This will install the necessary dependencies using Poetry and start your server using Uvicorn with automatic reloading enabled.
    With these steps completed, your server should be up and running, ready to handle requests.
